I’ve been wanting a space to share my journey, and now feels like the right time to start. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nSo a little about me: I’m Andrew, and I just kicked off the Information Technology Career Foundation Program (ITCFP) at Boeing. It’s a huge step for me, and honestly I’m both excited and a little nervous. The program is all about rotating through different IT roles, which means I’ll get to try out a bunch of areas, learn a ton, and figure out where I really want to land in this field.\n<br>\n<br>\nI just wrapped up my IT degree at the University of Washington Tacoma, and now I’m heading down a path focused on cybersecurity and cloud computing — with a goal of weaving AI into the mix whenever I can. Those three areas feel like the future of tech, and I want to be right in the middle of it.\n<br>\n<br>\nI started this blog because I want a place to document what I’m learning — not just the technical stuff, but also the day-to-day wins, challenges, and lessons along the way. I think it’ll be cool to look back later and see how far I’ve come, and maybe some of my experiences will help someone else starting out in IT too.\n<br>\n<br>\nYou can expect posts about projects I’m working on, random thoughts about tech, and probably a few stories about trying to balance work, school, and family life.\n<br>\n<br>\nThanks for checking this out — I’m looking forward to sharing more soon.",
